"The purpose of our brand is to have fun, but to also formulate opinions constructively. In today's world, it's difficult to have discussion about current events due to a fear of sparking trouble around issues others personally believe in.

With this site, people don't need to feel fearful. Because our forum is unbiased, users can express their opinion about anything even if others don't share the same belief. 
"We are all human" at the end of the day."
